# SQ Maze

The game started the tests with around 0.24$ CPI and around %25 D1 retention.
With many changes made on the game, CPI improved to around 0.08$ but retention remained around the same.
The idea was killed as ARPU got stuck at around 0.06$ despite all my efforts to increase it.

The game was tested with Supersonic and CPI turned out to be too high.

# Shoet

A game that tries to combine fps, tap-timing and fashion themes.
Concept didn't work out.
Wrote the custom shader that I used in this game, that increased the performance by over %100.
