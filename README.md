## SQ Maze

The game started the tests with around 0.24$ CPI and around %25 D1 retention.
With many changes made on the game, CPI improved to around 0.08$ but retention remained around the same.
The idea was killed as ARPU got stuck at around 0.06$.




## Kebabster

A game that combines Arkanoid mechanics with a shish kebab making theme.
It was tested with Supersonic and CPI turned out to be too high.




## Shoet

A game that tries to combine fps, tap-timing and fashion themes.
Wrote the custom shader that I used in this game from scratch, which increased the performance by over %100.
